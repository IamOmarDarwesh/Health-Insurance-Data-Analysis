Exploring Factors Affecting Insurance Cost &amp; Predict the Cost for a Health Insurance Company







**Overview:**




The cost of medical expenses is one of the major recurring expenses in a human life. It is known that one's life style dictates diseases or ailments one can have and these diseases or ailments dictate medical expenses. 


According to various studies, major factors that contribute to higher expenses in personal medical care include smoking, aging, BMI and more. 


Medical expenses are difficult to estimate because the most costly conditions are rare and seemingly random. Still, some conditions are more prevalent for certain segments of the population. For instance, lung cancer is more likely among smokers than non-smokers, and heart disease may be more likely among the obese.






**Objective:**



For a health insurance company to make money, it needs to collect more in yearly premiums than it spends on medical care to its beneficiaries.
Here, our objective is to find a correlation between personal medical expenses and different factors, and compare them. Then we use the attributes as predictors to predict medical expenses by creating linear regression model.
